# Rust-Airdrop Project
In this Quest We will be developing an airdrop program in Solana using the rust Language. Airdrop refers to the act of sending a cryptocurrency to a wallet, usually
for free, to either promote the cryptocurrency or enable developers to test out transactions over the blockchain without spending real money.
